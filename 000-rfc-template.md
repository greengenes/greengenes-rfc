# Summary

Brief description of the RFC.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail that somebody
familiar with the library could grok, and for a developer to implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include concrete examples
of how the feature is used.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

What parts of the design still need to be fleshed out? This may be left blank.
